For Cygwin:

(1) In order to use the Windows 10 toolchain in a non-Cygwin environment
(such as Eclipse), do the following after building GCC using ct-ng:

(2) Copy cygwin1.dll and cyggcc_s-seh-1.dll from C:/cygwin64/bin to the
toolchain's bin directory. If you update your Cygwin you may need to
repeat this step. Cygwin will be unhappy if the DLL versions do not match.

(3) Copy omp.h from another toolchain to  the toolchain's
lib/gcc/aarch64-openmp-elf/11.2.0/include directory.

(4) Create <toolchain>/usr.

(5) Move <toolchain>/libexec to <toolchain>/usr.

(6) Copy <toolchain>/aarch64-openmp-elf to <toolchain>/usr.

(7) If you need to install this GCC as an Eclipse toolchain, copy gdb.exe
from another toolchain to <toolchain>/bin and adjust its triplet prefix
as needed. My crosstool-ng .config files do not build gdb since I was
getting build errors. However, the Eclipse toolchain importer requires
gbd to be present, even if you don't use it. I have not tested whether
a copied gdb works, since I use Segger's Ozone debugger instead.

In the above instructions, adjust the path and filenames as needed, for
example, substitute arm-uboot-eabi for aarch64-openmp-elf.


For Linux:

Only do step 3, and perhaps step 7 if you need to import the
toolchain into Eclipse. I have not tested the need for step 7 on a Linux
system.
